# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies using npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can now start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

## API Routes

This project includes API routes that can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). The endpoint logic is defined in `pages/api/hello.js`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`, making these files act as API routes instead of React pages.

## Font Optimization

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font, ensuring a smooth and efficient loading experience.
